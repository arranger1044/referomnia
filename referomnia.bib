  Abstract                 = {{Abstract We introduce a new approach to learning statistical models from multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of proteins. Our method, called GREMLIN (Generative REgularized ModeLs of proteINs), learns an undirected probabilistic graphical model of the amino acid composition within the MSA. The resulting model encodes both the position-specific conservation statistics and the correlated mutation statistics between sequential and long-range pairs of residues. Existing techniques for learning graphical models from MSA either make strong, and often inappropriate assumptions about the conditional independencies within the MSA (e.g., Hidden {M}arkov Models), or else use suboptimal algorithms to learn the parameters of the model. In contrast, GREMLIN makes no a priori assumptions about the conditional independencies within the MSA. We formulate and solve a convex optimization problem, thus guaranteeing that we find a globally optimal model at convergence. The resulting model is also generative, allowing for the design of new protein sequences that have the same statistical properties as those in the MSA. We perform a detailed analysis of covariation statistics on the extensively studied WW and PDZ domains and show that our method out-performs an existing algorithm for learning undirected probabilistic graphical models from MSA. We then apply our approach to 71 additional families from the PFAM database and demonstrate that the resulting models significantly out-perform Hidden {M}arkov Models in terms of predictive accuracy.

  Abstract                 = {Intractable inference has been a major barrier to the wide adoption of statistical relational models. Existing exact methods suffer from a lack of scalability, and approximate methods tend to be unreliable. Sum-product networks (SPNs; Poon and Domingos 2011) are a recently-proposed probabilistic architecture that guarantees tractable exact inference, even on many high-treewidth models. SPNs are a propositional architecture, treating the instances as independent and identically distributed. In this paper, we extend SPNs to the relational setting, resulting in Relational Sum-Product Networks (RSPNs). Previous tractable statistical relational models (Domingos and Webb 2012; Webb and Domingos 2013) defined their models over a pre-determined set of objects, and therefore could not be generalized to new mega-examples. In contrast, RSPNs can be learned and applied to previous unseen examples. We present a learning algorithm for RSPNs; in preliminary experiments, RSPNs outperform {M}arkov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos 2006) in both running time and predictive accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce DropConnect, a generalization of DropOut, for regularizing large fully-connected layers within neural networks. When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.},
